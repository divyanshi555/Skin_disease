# SnapHeal– Skin Health Prototype

This project is a prototype of our *AI-powered student wellness platform, starting with a focus on skin health. The current version has been trained on a **small dataset* with three categories:

* Clear Skin
* Ringworm
* Acne

We showcase accuracy results, performance graphs, and the user interface to demonstrate feasibility.

## 🔍 Current Prototype
